## Description of Project:

This project helps the University of Iowa get a feel students perceptions of the major and the courses they take.

## How my web form conforms to best practices for forms:

For the assignment on best practices for web forms, I focused on several key aspects to enhance user experience and accessibility. First, I ensured that the form fields were clearly labeled, which helps users understand what information is needed. Each label was associated with its corresponding input field, making it easier for users, especially those using screen readers, to navigate the form. I also utilized placeholder text to provide additional guidance on the expected format of the input, such as "example@domain.com" for email fields.

Another important practice I implemented was the validation of user inputs. I included both client-side and server-side validation to ensure that the data entered was correct and complete before submission. This not only reduces errors but also improves the overall efficiency of data processing. Additionally, I provided real-time feedback to users when they filled out the form, such as highlighting fields that needed correction and offering clear error messages. This approach minimizes frustration and encourages users to complete the form successfully. Overall, these practices create a more user-friendly and efficient web form experience.

## How my form provides for user accessibility:

To make my web forms accessible to all users, I focused on several key accessibility features. I ensured that all form elements had descriptive labels that were programmatically associated with their corresponding input fields, which aids users who rely on screen readers. I also implemented keyboard navigation, allowing users to tab through the form fields easily without needing a mouse. Additionally, I used sufficient color contrast between text and background elements to ensure readability for users with visual impairments. By adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), I aimed to create an inclusive experience that accommodates diverse user needs.
